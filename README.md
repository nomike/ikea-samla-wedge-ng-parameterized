# IKEA SAMLA Tray Insert Wedge Parametric

This is a parametric remix of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3572388.

## Summary of the original design

> This is a minor upgrade to the "IKEA Samla Insert Wedge" by Dvogonen.
> 
> Its basic purpose is to push the small ends of the Samla tray insert apart, to prevent it from slipping over the notches down into the Samla box.
> 
> With the original design, I could not reliably get a double sided tape to stick onto the tray, so I designed a version with two 5mm holes. Use them as guides to drill holes of the same diameter into the tray and use either screws or a zip-tie to fasten the wedges in the tray.
> 
> There is also a cutout to save some material.
> 
> I printed in PLA with 2 perimeters and 10% infill. The part is mostly compressed from the side, so it should be sturdy enough.
