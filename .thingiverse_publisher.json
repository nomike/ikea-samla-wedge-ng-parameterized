    "description": "# IKEA SAMLA Tray Insert Wedge Parametric\n\nThis is a parametric remix of [IKEA Samla Tray Insert Wedge NG](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3572388) by iggyggi.\n\n## Summary of the original design\n\n> This is a minor upgrade to the \"IKEA Samla Insert Wedge\" by Dvogonen.\n> \n> Its basic purpose is to push the small ends of the Samla tray insert apart, to prevent it from slipping over the notches down into the Samla box.\n> \n> With the original design, I could not reliably get a double sided tape to stick onto the tray, so I designed a version with two 5mm holes. Use them as guides to drill holes of the same diameter into the tray and use either screws or a zip-tie to fasten the wedges in the tray.\n> \n> There is also a cutout to save some material.\n> \n> I printed in PLA with 2 perimeters and 10% infill. The part is mostly compressed from the side, so it should be sturdy enough.\n\n# Thingiverse\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6526779\n\n# GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nomike/ikea-samla-wedge-ng-parametric\n",
